# Starship USS Prometheus Technical Manual

**Class**: Prometheus-class Deep Space Explorer  
**Registry**: NCC-2847  
**Launch Date**: Stardate 2397.4

## Engine Specifications and Performance

The USS Prometheus is equipped with a revolutionary Quantum Slipstream Drive capable of achieving speeds up to Warp 9.97. The primary propulsion system consists of:

**Primary Systems:**
- Quantum Slipstream Drive Core: Type-XII Quantum Matrix
- Maximum Velocity: Warp 9.97 (sustainable for 12 hours)
- Cruising Speed: Warp 8.5 (indefinite duration)  
- Emergency Speed: Warp 9.99 (maximum 30 minutes)
- Fuel Efficiency: 847 light-years per quantum fuel cell

The drive utilizes a subspace folding mechanism that creates temporary corridors through higher-dimensional space.

## Defensive Systems and Armaments

The Prometheus-class incorporates advanced defensive technologies designed for deep space exploration:

**Shield Systems:**
- Multi-layered Deflector Shields: 2.4 x 10^6 TeraJoules maximum capacity
- Regenerative Shield Matrix with self-repair protocols
- Adaptive Frequency Modulation against energy weapons
- Metaphasic Shielding for stellar phenomena protection

**Weapons Array:**
- 12 Type-XV Phaser Arrays (360-degree coverage)
- 4 Forward Quantum Torpedo Launchers (standard capacity: 200 torpedoes)
- 2 Aft Photon Torpedo Launchers (standard capacity: 150 torpedoes)
- 1 Experimental Tachyon Pulse Cannon (forward arc only)
